Would you like to help ensure that MODELS 2026 is an unforgettable experience?



Are you a Bachelor, Master’s or PhD student interested in Model-Driven Engineering? Student volunteers play an essential role in the successful organization of the MODELS conference. Volunteering provides an excellent opportunity for students from all over the world to meet and exchange ideas with leading researchers and practitioners in the community. It also provides you with excellent opportunities to meet other international students!

Volunteer Benefits
As a student volunteer, you can meet, interact, and network with academic and industrial representatives of the Model-Driven Engineering community. Actively participating in a leading event like MODELS can even influence and shape your research direction. You will know that you have contributed to the success of the conference. We offer additional incentives:

Free registration for the full conference week, incl. main conference & satellite events
Included lunches and coffee breaks during the conference and access to social events (excl. gala dinner)
Student volunteer T-shirt
Student volunteers must use their own funds for traveling and accommodation, for instance, as provided by their university or supervisor. Note that the student volunteer registration does not include the possibility to register a paper.

Your Responsibilities
We expect you to be available during the conference, including satellite events, but aim to limit the total active work hours to 20-25 hours during the conference week. In addition, we may ask you to be available the day before the conference for preparations and orientation.

You will be assigned to tasks such as:

Help at the registration desk (e.g., set up, distribute conference bags, assist with registration)
Technical support during the sessions, panels, and poster sessions
Providing directions and/or checking badges and tickets
Provide general guidance to attendees
Where feasible, we will assign student volunteers to a satellite event and/or conference session that matches their scientific interests. Please indicate this on the application form. Please note that we cannot guarantee any specific placement.
