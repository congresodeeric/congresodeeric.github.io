MODELS will be hosted at the Melia Costa del Sol hotel. The MODELS organization has negociated special rates available for MODELS participants, lower than the standard public rates.

Note, however, that the hotel’s pricing is based on a dynamic rate system, guests who book earlier benefit from more favorable prices, as higher discounts apply at the initial stages. As availability decreases and the dates approach, rates will progressively increase.

There are numerous alternative accommodation options available nearby for those who prefer a different choice. However, the organizers strongly encourage early booking, as accommodation availability in the area is typically limited due to high demand.
