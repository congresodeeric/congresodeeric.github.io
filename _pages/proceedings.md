As in previous years, there will be joint workshop proceedings published by ACM that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers, including, if applicable, the workshop program committee, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop.
Submissions must adhere to the ACM formatting instructions, which can be found here. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for extended abstracts and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format as the main tracks of the conference. This year, please note that the proceedings are subject to the ACM Open Access policy. In addition to the ACM subsidy, SIGSOFT is subsidizing ACM Open as follows in 2026: papers in the extended abstracts category (5 pages + references) from workshops will be published open-access free of charge.
